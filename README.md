Purpose:
========

All In To Fight Cancer is a non-profit event in Charlotte that raises funds for
cancer treatment and research.  It does so primarily by generating interest and
participation in a poker tournament.  This application intends to help promote
and grow the event.

It's a house project of [Launchpad Code
Academy](http://www.launchpadcodeacademy.com/) to demonstrate effective
professional software engineering habits and techniques.


Our [Edit Story pull request](https://github.com/itsbspoke/aitfc/pull/8) covered
a lot of basic Rails competencies.  We created a model, and updated that model
via the web.

Our [Social Media integration pull request](https://github.com/itsbspoke/aitfc/pull/9)
covered the introduction of Omniauth to handle attaching third-party credentials
to an account.

Our next pull request will cover using background processes using Sidekiq!
